# Getting started with London Mock Exchange Frontend

This React App was made in conjunction with https://github.com/arabellaknowles/london-mock-exchange-backend and uses it as a backend. We recommend if you would like to use this app, that you also clone that repository and follow the instructions on the README.md there to get the app up and running. In further, we used the Marketstack API to get the historical data used for making trades.

## Set Up

1. Ensure you have npm installed before cloning the repo
2. Clone this repo onto your local machine
3. Run `$ npm install`
4. Run `$ npm start`
5. Get the backend API up and running on your local machine
6. Navigate to [localhost](http://localhost:3000)

## Technologies Used

* React
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

## Future Additions

After initial production we have plans to make this application allow for live trading to be done. Additionally, we will be looking to add more performance statistics on the transaction and the portfolios themselves.
